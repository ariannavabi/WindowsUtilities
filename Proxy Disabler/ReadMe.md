# Proxy Disabler App

Proxy Disabler is a very simple app that disables windows proxy when you run it.

This app is useful for when you **turn off your PC** while the **VPN is not turned off.** Usualy when this happens, you have to disable the proxy in the settings to be able to use the internet. Doing this task manualy is a bit boring, so I made this simple app that does it automatically & quickly for you!

**If you're not used to GitHub and you're confused, just click [here](https://github.com/ariannavabi/WindowsUtilities/raw/main/Proxy%20Disabler/ProxyDisabler.exe) to download the app! ðŸ˜ƒ**

![Here's how the app looks!](https://github.com/ariannavabi/WindowsUtilities/blob/main/Proxy%20Disabler/ProxyDisablerV2.0.0.0_SourceCode/ProxyDisabler_Screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

The app is pretty simple and no installations is needed. Just drop the file somewhere and run it, it will automatically disable your proxy & then show a result message.

## How to use  
  Download the [ProxyDisabler.exe](https://github.com/ariannavabi/WindowsUtilities/raw/main/Proxy%20Disabler/ProxyDisabler.exe) file to use the app. No installations is needed, you only need to open the file.
  
  The app does not have any rich user interfaces, when you open it, it does it's job in the background automaticaly & then shows a simple MessageBox telling you that the proxy is disabled.
  The app will be closed When you click the `Ok` button.
  
  **Warning:** Be careful with opening this app when a VPN app is connected at the same, because it may create a duality between what the VPN app indicates & what the reality is. How ever it's nothing to be worry about & there are no dangers! It just might make you confused! So it's better to use this app when no VPNs are running.
  
  ### Run on Start-Up
  This app is not capable of running automatically on startup. If you want the app to do so, you should manually add it to the windows start-up folder. Here's how to do so:
  1. Open "Run" by pressing `win + r`
  2. Type in `shell:startup` & press enter
  3. Paste the app in the folder that is opened
  





## Source Code
  The [ProxyDisablerV2.0.0.0_SourceCode](https://github.com/ariannavabi/WindowsUtilities/tree/main/Proxy%20Disabler/ProxyDisablerV2.0.0.0_SourceCode) folder is where the source code exists. This app is written in C# language (Windows Form Application); so you'll need Visual Studio & `.Net Framework` Installed to be able to edit the source code. The app itself how ever, does not need any extra instalations.
