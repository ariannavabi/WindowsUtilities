These are the apps & tools I made to make my workflow faster & more joyful!

Each folder of this repository is dedicated to a project i've done.
You can download the apps or their source code & use them. I hope it helps! :)

**Here's a list of what each app does:**

  ## Telegram Emojis Shortcuts
  This app allows you to send emojis using the function keys (F1, F2, ...) in the Telegram messenger.
  
  In Telegram, some imojis are automatically converted to animated stickers. You can send un-stickered emojis with this app as well.
  It is writen with AutoHotKeys scripts & you can change the emojis for each shortcut using the sourcecode.
  
## ProxyDisabler
  This app is useful for when you turn off your PC while the VPN is not turned off. Usualy when this happens, you have to disable the proxy in the settings to be able to use the internet. Doing this task manualy is a bit boring, so I made this simple app that does it automatically & quickly for you!
