# Telegram Emojis Shortcuts App

This app allows you to send emojis using the function keys (F1, F2, ...) in Telegram. It also alows you to send emojis as a non-Animated-Sticker format. The app is written using the AutoHotKeys scripting app & it works by sending keyboard inputs when you press a specific function key.
